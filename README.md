## Instructions

Load the [Memory Game](index.html) to begin play. The game board will load shuffled and ready to go with a welcome message atop the
board. 

### Content

* [Index Page](index.html) - this is the HTML page that houses all of the HTML script for building the 
foundation of the game itself.
* [CSS Page](css/app.css) - this is the styling page for the HTML page; this page contains all of the styling for the index page
and the game board activity. This includes not only colors and pictures but also the animations for the cards flipping and mathching.
* [JavaScript Page](js/app.js) - this is the JavaScript coded page that controls the game board. This contains all the variables, 
functions, and connections between all the pages to make the game playable.

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
