## Instructions

Load the [Memory Game](index.html) to begin play. The game board will load shuffled and ready to go with a welcome message atop the
board. 

### Content

* [Index Page](index.html) - this is the page that houses all of the HTML script for building the 
foundation of the game itself; this includes the board, cards, icons, stars, etc.
* [CSS Page](css/app.css) - this is the styling page for the HTML page; this page contains all of the styling for the index page
and the game board activity. This includes not only colors and pictures but also the animations for the cards flipping and mathching.
* [JavaScript Page](js/app.js) - this is the JavaScript coded page that controls the game board. This contains all the variables, 
functions, and connections between all the pages to make the game playable.
* [Geometry2.png](img/geometry2.png) - this is the image for the background of the gameboard shown on the index.html.

## Buildout

I started the project by looking over all three files (index.html, app.css and app.js); after reviewing the connection between them I loaded the html page and attempted to manipulate the game board. I then used Chrome's Dev tools to inspect everything I could and began code out from there.

It was a constant back and forth of scripting in Atom, saving and refreshing in Chrome and then utilizing the console in Chrome to research changes and functions to attain proper game functions.

## Resources

I reviewed lessons within the Udacity Front End Web Dev course on loops, arrays, setTimeOut and other functions to create connections between functions themselves, the css page and html page. I also utilized the documentation from [Mozilla's JavaScript Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) as well as the tutorials and walk throughs from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/). Finally, I referenced a blog from [Matthew Cranford](https://matthewcranford.com/memory-game-walkthrough-part-1-setup/) for a couple connections I was unable to decipher alone, but created my own code from his examples and breakdowns.
